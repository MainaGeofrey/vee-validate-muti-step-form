Payment Status Check API Documentation

Overview

The following two tables contain the information saved when an M-Pesa payment gateway transaction occurs:

1. safaricom_mpesa_payments: Contains general payment details.
2. safaricom_mpesa_c2b_transaction_logs: Contains detailed transaction logs for C2B payments.

The two tables are related by the `transaction_token` column, so that each record in `safaricom_mpesa_payments` has associated records in `safaricom_mpesa_c2b_transaction_logs` that provide detailed information about the payment process.

Workflow

Each payment process starts with creating a payment intent, applicable for both STK (Auto Pay) and Paybill transactions. 
The `transaction_token` uniquely identifies every payment. The following are the expected transaction logs for each type of payment:

- Paybill:
  - Two transaction logs in safaricom_mpesa_c2b_transaction_logs:
    1. Validation request.
    2. Confirmation request.

- STK:
  - Three transaction logs in safaricom_mpesa_c2b_transaction_logs:
    1. Validation request.
    2. Confirmation request.
    3. Callback request.

The confirmation and callback logs provide critical details about the transaction's outcome.
